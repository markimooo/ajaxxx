  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p>I have read too many mangas, too many of them. But what I enjoy the most is slice of life, romcom, action and a good one that stands out from the rest taking the genre to a whole new favorite.</p>

  <h2>Gaming</h2>
  <p>I play mostly video games which I enjoy are movement fps, souls like, open-world and rougelike. Board games and card games are the best form of entertainment for me because I can see the reactions of my friends when playing.</p>

   <h2>Exploring</h2>
  <p>Exploring can be understood from one's own perspective, for me it's something that made us evolve and push through. As we learn, we grow an be mature. Exploring may not be a hobby but it's like a hobby to me since I like going to hikings, </p>
